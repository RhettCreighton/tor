# Code of Conduct

## Our Principles

This project values:
- **Free and open exchange of ideas** - We support First Amendment principles
- **Technical merit above all** - The best code wins, regardless of who wrote it
- **Constructive debate** - Disagreement is encouraged when it improves the code
- **Privacy and anonymity** - Core values of the Tor project

## Guidelines

1. **Focus on the code, not the person**
   - Critique implementations, not individuals
   - Judge contributions by technical merit alone

2. **Be direct and honest**
   - Clear, direct feedback improves code quality
   - Sugar-coating wastes everyone's time

3. **Respect privacy**
   - Don't dox or reveal personal information
   - Pseudonymous contributions are welcome

4. **Stay on topic**
   - This is about building great software
   - Political/personal disputes belong elsewhere

## What We Don't Do

- We don't police speech or thoughts
- We don't require agreement on non-technical matters
- We don't discriminate based on identity or beliefs
- We don't prioritize feelings over code quality

## Resolution

Technical disputes: Resolved by code benchmarks, tests, and demonstrations
Severe disruption: Temporary muting for spam or completely off-topic content only

The goal is simple: **Build the best privacy software possible.**
